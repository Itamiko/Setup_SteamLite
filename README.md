## Installing SteamLite for lazy people
Individually copying the required files to get SteamLite working for me was
taking too long. So I created these scripts to speed up the
installation of SteamLite.

## What do each script do?
- src/FullSteamLite.ps1
> Installs SteamLite with in-gameoverlays

- src/FullSteamLiteWithGreenLuma.ps1
> Installs SteamLite with in-gameoverlays but includes GreenLuma

- src/NoInGameOverlay.ps1
> Install SteamLite with no in-gameoverlay

- src/NoInGameOverlayWithGreenLuma.ps1
> Install SteamLite with no in-gameoverlay but includes GreenLuma
